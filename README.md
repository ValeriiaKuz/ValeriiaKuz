<br>
Behind me, I have 8 years of medical education and several years of experience as a pediatric nephrologist 🤯, but now I am on the path of learning programming 🤓<br>
I've been doing it for less than a year, but with a strong sense of responsibility 🫡 <br>
💪 I finished the Yandex Frontend.React course and then I developed several small projects of my own 🤘. I dedicate 6-8 hours every day to learning and working on my pet project. <br>
🌱 Now I am in RS School(@rolling-scopes-school) and realy hope to finish it and be one of the top 100 students
